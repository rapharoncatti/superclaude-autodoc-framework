# SuperClaude2Init - Self-Implementing Installation Guide

**🚀 Complete SuperClaude v2.0 System Implementation Instructions for Claude Code**

## OVERVIEW

This file contains comprehensive instructions for Claude to implement the complete SuperClaude v2.0 framework in any new session. SuperClaude v2.0 is an enhanced AI development framework that combines persona-switching intelligence with real-time MCP integration for maximum efficiency.

**What Claude Will Implement:**
- ✅ 3 Working MCPs (Context7, Sequential, Puppeteer)  
- ✅ 9 Expert Personas with specialized roles
- ✅ 19 Specialized Commands with auto persona-switching
- ✅ 6 Complete Workflows for development patterns
- ✅ V2.0 Optimizations (80% token reduction, anti-hallucination)
- ✅ Real-time MCP integration (not simulated)

## STEP 1: CLONE AND SETUP THE FRAMEWORK

```bash
# Clone the complete SuperClaude v2.0 repository
git clone https://github.com/rapharoncatti/superclaude-autodoc-framework.git
cd superclaude-autodoc-framework

# Install ALL required dependencies (may fail on exFAT due to symlink restrictions)
npm install

# If npm install fails due to symlink issues (common on exFAT partitions):
npm install -g js-yaml glob

# Alternative: Install locally without symlinks
npm install --no-bin-links js-yaml glob

# Verify installation (use one of these depending on install method):
npm list js-yaml glob                    # For local install
npm list -g js-yaml glob                 # For global install

# Test the system (works regardless of install method)
node final-system-test.js
```

## STEP 2: VERIFY MCP SERVERS

SuperClaude v2.0 requires 3 working MCP servers. Verify each one:

### Context7 MCP (Documentation Research)
```bash
# Test Context7 availability
npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp

# If working, you should see Context7 MCP server starting
# This provides documentation research capabilities
```

### Sequential MCP (Adaptive Analysis)
```bash
# Install Sequential MCP server if not available
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking

# OR check if already installed:
ls ~/.nvm/versions/node/*/lib/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking

# If not found, use this fallback path check:
find ~ -name "*sequential-thinking*" -type d 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

### Puppeteer MCP (Web Automation)
```bash
# SuperClaude v2.0 includes a custom Puppeteer MCP wrapper
# This is included in the framework at core/puppeteer-mcp-wrapper.js
# It provides web automation and testing capabilities
```

## STEP 3: CONFIGURE MCP INTEGRATION

**IMPORTANT**: Claude Code must be configured to use SuperClaude MCPs. This step requires manual configuration by the user.

### Find your Claude Code MCP configuration file:
```bash
# Typical locations:
ls ~/.config/claude-code/mcp-config.json
ls ~/.claude/mcp-config.json

# If not found, create it:
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code
```

### Add SuperClaude MCPs to your configuration:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    },
    "sequential": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.0/lib/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking/dist/index.js"]
    },
    "superclaude-puppeteer": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./core/puppeteer-mcp-wrapper.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Update the sequential MCP path to match your actual installation path from Step 2.

## STEP 4: INITIALIZE SUPERCLAUDE SESSION

**For Claude Code Users**: SuperClaude v2.0 is designed to be used interactively through Claude Code, not as a standalone Node.js application.

### Interactive Usage (Recommended):
```bash
# After completing Steps 1-3, restart Claude Code to load MCP configurations
# Then use SuperClaude commands directly in conversation:

# Examples:
# "Use the /design command to architect a scalable authentication system"
# "Apply the /secure command to audit our API endpoints" 
# "Execute the /optimize command to improve performance"
```

### Programmatic Usage (Advanced):
```javascript
// Create a test file: test-superclaude.js
const ActiveSuperClaudeSession = require('./core/active-superclaude-session.js');

async function testSuperClaude() {
    try {
        const session = new ActiveSuperClaudeSession();
        await session.initializeSession('test project context');
        
        console.log('✅ SuperClaude v2.0 initialized successfully');
        console.log('Current persona:', session.currentPersona?.name || 'None');
        
        return session;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('❌ SuperClaude initialization failed:', error.message);
        return null;
    }
}

// Run test
testSuperClaude().then(session => {
    if (session) {
        console.log('🎉 SuperClaude v2.0 is ready for use!');
    }
});
```

```bash
# Test the initialization:
node test-superclaude.js
```

## STEP 9: VERIFY COMPLETE SYSTEM

Test the complete SuperClaude v2.0 system:

```bash
# Run comprehensive system test
node final-system-test.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ 3/3 MCPs Working: Context7, Sequential, Puppeteer
# ✅ 6/6 Core Features: All major components functional
# ✅ Active MCP Usage: MCPs called during processing
# ✅ Sub-second Response Times: Optimized performance
```

## STEP 10: USAGE EXAMPLES

### Natural Language Processing with SuperClaude Commands
```bash
# SuperClaude automatically selects persona and MCPs based on request
# Example conversations with Claude Code:

# Security Analysis (→ Security persona + Sequential + Context7 + Puppeteer):
"Use SuperClaude to analyze the security vulnerabilities in our authentication system"

# Performance Optimization (→ Performance persona + Sequential + Context7 + Puppeteer):
"Apply SuperClaude to optimize the performance of our React components"

# Architecture Design (→ Architect persona + Sequential + Context7):
"Execute SuperClaude to design a scalable microservices architecture"
```

### Direct Command Usage
```bash
# Use specific commands for precise control:
"Apply the /secure command to audit API endpoints with OAuth and rate limiting"
"Execute the /optimize command on database queries focusing on indexing and caching"
"Use the /test command for user workflows with end-to-end automation"
```

### Workflow Execution
```bash
# Execute complete workflows using natural language:
"Run the feature development workflow for user authentication with OAuth, MFA, and session management requirements"
"Execute the security audit workflow for our payment processing system"
"Apply the performance optimization workflow to our database layer"
```

## STEP 11: TROUBLESHOOTING

### Installation Issues
```bash
# Problem: npm install fails with EPERM symlink errors
# Solution: Use alternative installation methods

# Method 1: Install globally
npm install -g js-yaml glob

# Method 2: Install without symlinks  
npm install --no-bin-links

# Method 3: Use yarn instead of npm
yarn install

# Verify SuperClaude core files exist:
ls -la core/
```

### MCP Connection Issues  
```bash
# Check MCP server status
ps aux | grep -E "(context7|sequential|puppeteer)"

# Test individual MCPs
npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp --test
node core/puppeteer-mcp-wrapper.js --test

# Verify MCP configuration path
ls ~/.config/claude-code/mcp-config.json

# Check MCP server paths exist
ls ~/.nvm/versions/node/*/lib/node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Enable performance monitoring
export SUPERCLAUDE_DEBUG=performance
node core/active-superclaude-session.js

# Check Node.js version compatibility
node --version  # Should be >= 18.0.0
```

### Cache Issues
```bash
# Clear SuperClaude cache
rm -rf .superclaude-cache/
rm -rf cache/

# Clear npm cache if needed
npm cache clean --force
```

## STEP 12: INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING PROJECTS

### For React Projects
```bash
# Copy SuperClaude core/ directory to your React project
cp -r /path/to/superclaude-autodoc-framework/core ./superclaude-core

# Then use SuperClaude commands in Claude Code:
"Initialize SuperClaude for React component development"
"Use /build to create a TypeScript UserProfile component with testing"
```

### For API Projects  
```bash
# Integration example conversations:
"Initialize SuperClaude for REST API development"
"Apply /design to create microservices user authentication architecture"
"Execute /secure to audit API endpoints with OAuth implementation"
```

### For Performance Projects
```bash
# Performance optimization workflows:
"Initialize SuperClaude for performance optimization tasks"
"Use /analyze to identify memory and CPU bottlenecks"
"Apply /optimize to improve database queries and indexing"
```
